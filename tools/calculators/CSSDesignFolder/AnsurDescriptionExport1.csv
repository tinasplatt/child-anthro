the knuckles (metacarpal-phalangeal joints).","The distance from the base of the hand at the wrist crease 
to the tip of the middle finger.","The maximum breadth of the head, usually above and 
behind the ears.
","The maximum horizontal circumference of the head, 
measured with the tape passing above the brow-ridges and the ears. 
","The maximum length of the head, measured from the most 
anterior point of the forehead between the brow-ridges (glabella) to the 
back of the head (occiput).","The maximum breadth across the hips, measured 
with the subject standing.","The vertical distance from the floor to the 
level of the maximum posterior protrusion of the greater trochanter of 
the femur (trochanterion). 
","The vertical distance from the footrest surface 
to the top of the knee, measured with the subject sitting. ","The vertical distance between a standing surface and the standing lateral-femoral-epicondyle
landmark on the outside of the right knee is measured with an anthropometer. The subject stands erect with the heels together and the weight distributed equally on both
feet.","The vertical distance between a standing surface and the tip of the right middle finger
when the arm is extended overhead as high as possible is measured on a wall scale.The
subject stands on his/her toes facing a wall-mounted scale with both arms parallel and
extended overhead as high as possible.The toes are 20 em from the wall and the feet are
about 10 em apart. The palms of the hands rest on the scale.A block is placed against
the tip of the finger to establish the measurement. The measurement is taken at the
maximum point of quiet respiration.","The vertical distance between a sitting surface and the tip of the right middle finger of
a seated subject whose arm is extended overhead is measured on a wall scale.The subject
sits erect on a flat surface 40.8 em high with the right arm and hand extended vertically
overhead as far as possible and the palm of the hand facing forward.Neither the back
nor the arm touches a wall.block placed at the tip of the middle finger spans the
distance between the finger and the wall and establishes the measurement on the wall
scale. The measurement is made at the maximum point of quiet respiration.","The vertical distance from the footrest 
surface to the underside of the lower leg, measured with the subject 
sitting.

is measured on a wall chart.The subject stands erect with the back against a wallmounted
scale and the heels together. Both arms and hands are stretched horizontally
against a back wall with the tip of the middle finger of one hand just touching a side wall. A block is placed at the tip of the middle finger of the other hand to establish the
measurement on the scale. he measurement is taken at the maximum point of quiet
respiration.",The vertical distance from the floor to the top of the head.,"The vertical distance from the floor to the 
lowest point of the notch in the upper edge of the breast bone 
(suprasternale).

level of the navel (omphalion).","The horizontal distance between the stylion landmark on the right wrist and the center
of a dowel (1-1/4""""diameter) gripped in the right hand is measured with a Poech caliper. The subject sits grasping a dowel in the right hand. The base of the dowel is flush with
the bottom of the fist. The subject puts the bottom of the fist on a flat surface in such
a way that the base of the dowel rests on the surface. The fist is in line with the long axis
of the forearm.","The distance between the stylion landmark on the right wrist and the tip of the right index
finger is measured with a Poech caliper. The subject places the palm on a table, the
fingers together, and the thumb abducted. The middle finger is parallel to the long axis

of the outstretched arm is measured on a wall scale. The subject stands erect in a comer
looking straight ahead with the feet together and the heels 20 cm from the back wall. The
buttocks and shoulders are against the wall. The right arm and hand with the palm.down
are stretched forward horizontally against a scale on the side wall. The thumb continues
the horizontal line of the arm and the index finger curves around to touch the pad at the
end of the thumb. The subject's right shoulder is held against the rear wall."
